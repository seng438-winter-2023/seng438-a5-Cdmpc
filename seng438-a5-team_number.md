# Introduction
The purpose of this lab was to get familiar with recording failure rate using plots from a reliabiity assesment tool such as SRTAT
to assess the reliability over time of a SUT as it gets used more and more often over longer periods of time.

# Comparison of Results

# Discussion on Similarity and Differences of the Two Techniques

# How the team work/effort was divided and managed
Neil did the plotting for the graphs and some of the write up for the lab. Carlos did majority of the lab write up.

# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

# Comments/feedback on the lab itself
Our group noticed significant deviations between this lab and the previous four. Although we acquired useful knowledge that enhanced our understanding of the course material, we struggled initially due to the insufficient guidance presented in the assignment guidelines. In our view, it would be advantageous for future students to have access to more detailed instructions and software that works seamlessly with modern operating systems.
